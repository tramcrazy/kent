# Amalfi

Amalfi is a town and _comune_ in the province of Salerno, in the region of Campania, Italy, on the Gulf of Salerno. It lies at the mouth of a deep ravine, at the foot of Monte Cerreto, surrounded by dramatic cliffs and coastal scenery. The town of Amalfi was the capital of the maritime republic known as the Duchy of Amalfi, an important trading power in the Mediterranean between 839 and around 1200. One of the main sites in Amalfi is the Amalfi Cathedral.  <span data-click-image-zoomto="3757,1851,598,743">The cathedral</span> richly represents the artistic movement prevailing in Southern Italy at the time of the Normans, with its tendency to blend the Byzantine style with the forms and sharp lines of the northern architecture.[^1]
