# About the site and project

This site is the product of a collaboration between [JSTOR Labs](https://labs.jstor.org) and a team led by Carolyn Oulton, Professor of Victorian Literature in the School of Humanities and Educational Studies, Canterbury Christ Church University.

The site provides a set of themed essays about Kent, a county in South East England.  Kent has a rich history and provided inspiration for a number of writers and artists including Charles Dickens, who is featured in the early essays available on the site.

The JSTOR Labs team is providing tools and infrastructure for presenting the essays with interactive visualizations that are generated from annotations inserted in the text by the essay authors.  The visualizations include interactive maps with feature overlays that provide context for associated paragraphs in the essay. Much of the data used in the contextualized visualizations is obtained from open access knowledge graphs such as [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), the primary data source behind Wikipedia.

Framed by the idea of ‘writers and their times’, the project is researching historic, literary and geographical records to create an interactive experience seen through multi-disciplinary lenses. This approach contextualises literature and textual records of historic events through an emphasis on the material conditions in which they were produced and circulated. 

But rather than simply recreating a historic experience, the research aims to problematise the ways in which we interpret and represent the past. What do we think we know about the history of local landscapes? How do conflicting perspectives and gaps in the record remind us that representation is always selective and that hi_story_ is just that – a story we tell to others and ourselves?

As the map grows so too will the capacity for making unforeseen connections. While the project inevitably reflects the interests of the research team, it is highly collaborative and is not designed to showcase or privilege any one argument over another. Instead it will help you find your own answers to questions you haven’t thought of yet.

The project team hosts an annual [Kent Digital Maps Symposium](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/arts-and-humanities/school-of-humanities/research/victorian-women-writers/seminar-series/kent-maps-online-symposium.aspx) and has their own YouTube channel: [Kent Maps Online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIbFfzsJzaeYwVNuCeF50w).

She works from life, memory and imagination – welding the spirit of place with an exploration of the human condition. Developing a relationship with a place is central to Lisa’s practice, as the memories of each subsequent visit changes her perceptions – the weather, her own moods, current affairs, together with personal and collective associations.

Arriving in East Kent two days before her second birthday, Diana Hirst has been rooted in its landscape ever since. While in exile, first on London clay and subsequently on Suffolk clay, she has regularly returned to Deal.

Now at Canterbury Christ Church, she has completed a PhD on Elizabeth Bowen, a writer she’s been interested in since she first read Eva Trout in 1969 and discovered the heroine trampling over landscapes she had fondly imagined belonged to her alone. But this began to make sense when she discovered that Bowen, too, had put down roots in East Kent ...

Richard Maltby, retired head of history at The King’s School in Canterbury and author of an illustrated history of Canterbury (Pevensey Press, 1994), takes us through the growth of Canterbury in the 20th century to become the foremost commercial, educational and tourist centre in the south-east outside London. He takes us through the maps of the human and physical impact of two world wars and the accelerating economic pressures of the late 20th century upon the historic and spiritual character of England’s most ancient cathedral city. A section to be completed offsets the 20th century urban and commercial expansion of the city by the successful preservation of recreational areas and the green spaces along the banks and islands of the river Sour as it divides through the city.
